vanilla token
=============================================

# Running the app

1. This app requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).
2. Change directory into the main folder structure: `cd vanilla-token`
3. Install the NPM packages/dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the app: `gulp dev`

# The Tech

* The application uses Browserify for module management.
* No other dependencies are used, the code is HTML5, SASS (SCSS), and vanilla JavaScript.
* Gulp creates a `build` folder when the `gulp dev` task is run. This is where the application is served from.
* The application runs on this URL: http://localhost:3001/
